to work with npm;
first we need to initialize npm in our node project,the root directory;
command: astrophile㉿astro)-[~/nodeJs_Practice/npmModules]> npm init

 bellow all scenario after npm init command:
                                                                                                                               
┌──(astrophile㉿astro)-[~/nodeJs_Practice/npmModules]
└─$ npm init                       
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this OK? (yes) hit enter and done

now package.json file is added to our root directory,npmModules

question; what is package in root folder?
Basically,it conatins all our packages we import through npm to owr root directory,mean 
all conatins all dependencies.
1. npm i chalk or npm install chalk 
 chalk--> chalk manuplates the backgrounds of our console outputs
 now an another directory called nodu_modules will be added to root directory
 it contains all the required code of our dependencies.
2. npm i validator
 -->this module is used to valildates alll our validation required in forms 
   it is very usefull and shorthand for validation
