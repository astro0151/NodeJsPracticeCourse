web server:
To access web page of any web application,
we need a web server.The web server will handle all the 
http requests for the web application.

eg: IIS is a web server of ASPM.net web application.
apache---> for php / java web application.

Nodejs provides capabilities to create our own web server which
    will handle http requests asynchronousely. we can use IIS or 
    Apache to run Nodejs web application.But it is recommended to 
    use Nodejs web server(own created).

The http.createServer()---> method includes request and response parameters 
        which is supplied by nodejs.
    The request object can be used to get infromation 
    about the current HTTP request.
    eg: url,request header,and data....

    The response can be used to send a response for a current Http request.
    if the response from the http seerver is supposed to be displayed as html,
    se should include an http header with the correct content type.
